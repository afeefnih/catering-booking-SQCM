- `occasion`: Event type
- `event_date`: Scheduled event date
- `total_budget`: Order amount

## Error Handling

- Failed email attempts are logged with detailed error messages
- System continues to function even if email sending fails

## Security Features

- Email content is properly escaped to prevent XSS
- Database queries use prepared statements
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Email addresses are validated before sending

## Testing Instructions

1. **Email System Test**:
   ```
   Navigate to: http://your-domain/Project/test_email.php
   ```
   This will send a test email to verify the system is working.

2. **Payment Flow Test**:
   - Create a test order through req_quotation_form.php
   - Complete payment process in ToyyibPay sandbox
   - Verify email notifications are received for each status

3. **Callback Test**:
   - Ensure toyyibpay_callback.php is accessible from internet (use ngrok for localhost)
   - Monitor callback logs for successful processing
   - Verify callback-triggered emails are sent

## Configuration Requirements

### Email Configuration (config.php)
- Gmail SMTP settings are properly configured
- App-specific password is set for Gmail account
- Sender information is defined

### Database Requirements
- `orders` table must have `email` field
- `payment` table must exist with proper foreign key relationship
- Database connection must be established in mysqli_connect.php

## Production Considerations

### Before Going Live:
1. **Remove test_email.php** - Delete this file from production server
2. **Update email addresses** - Change test email addresses in config.php
3. **Enable signature verification** - Implement ToyyibPay signature verification in callback
4. **Set up proper SSL** - Ensure callback URL uses HTTPS
5. **Monitor email delivery** - Set up email delivery monitoring
6. **Test thoroughly** - Complete end-to-end testing in sandbox mode

### Monitoring:
- Check toyyibpay_callback.log for callback processing
- Monitor email sending success rates
- Watch for database update errors
- Track payment status accuracy

## Benefits

1. **Customer Experience**: Immediate notification of payment status
2. **Transparency**: Clear communication about order and payment status
3. **Support Reduction**: Automated status updates reduce support inquiries
4. **Order Management**: Automatic triggers for order fulfillment
5. **Professional Image**: Branded, well-formatted email communications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Emails not sending**: Check Gmail app password and SMTP settings
2. **Callback not working**: Verify callback URL accessibility
3. **Database errors**: Check foreign key relationships and data types
4. **Missing customer data**: Verify order_id mapping between payment and orders tables

### Log Files to Check:
- `toyyibpay_callback.log`: Callback processing logs
- PHP error logs: Email sending errors
- Database logs: Connection and query issues

The email notification system is now fully integrated and ready for testing. The system provides comprehensive coverage for all payment scenarios and ensures customers are kept informed throughout the payment process.
